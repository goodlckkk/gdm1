!!! WARNING !!!

All tools in this repository are "as is". No warranty at all. You break your station you pay for repair.


This project started as curiosity why can't I turn on this cheap 5500 station that i bought on internet. Lead to spending 4-5 months disassembling multiple firmwares from multiple stations. This all is work in progress, still evolving, still improving.

Tools available now:

docu - contains various documentation for Geodimeter totalstations 400/500/4000/600
gdm600 - tools for geodimeter 600
gdm-iface - interface to communicate with 400/500/4000 series of stations



If you find problem, or have some more information, or have fix for some tool use github's issue tracking system.
