#compensator:
labels 104, 106, 109, 107, 108

104 and 106 are gains of axis 1 and 2
107 and 108 are offsets - calculated during "comp init"

109 is cross parameter (rotation of compensator ?)

compinit labels: 167,168,169,138

167 number of avg rounds

168 and 169 are accumlators of the axis 1 and 2

during init stage they compensator value is sampled "label 167" times.

Max and min of each axis is stored

during evaluation followin must hold:

(max-min) * gain < "label 138"

(acc / "label 167") * gain < 0.10
